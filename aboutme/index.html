    <h2>Taylor Shirley</h2>
    <p style="font-size:120%;">Hello, I'm Taylor Shirley. I grew up in Michigan and love the green trees there. I'm a senior and i"m majoring in <br>
        Computer Information Technology. I love the outdoors. Growing up I did a lot of backpacking with my father and brothers.<br>
        I recently taught myself how to fly fish and have been enjoying the Idaho river. I think that nature helps reconnect us to our<br>
        Heavenly Father. I am also a huge nerd and love technology. I love to play video games with my freinds. I am also married<br>
        and enjoy living with my wife. She is the love of my life. We hit our one year on July 31st.
